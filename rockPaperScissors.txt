Goal: have a workable rock paper scissors game that can recieve string input and respond with a randomly generated computer play along with the score. The game should be able to differentiate between a correct string response and gibberish and quitting. Also should keep count of current round.

input: valid input is users choice of "rock" "paper" "scissors" or "q" for quit

output: output for valid input would be a regurgitation of player's choice
	the computer's randomly generate choice
	the outcome
	the score
	start of next game with increased round count
	
	if "q" is input, then display outro and exit program

	output for invalid input should display error message and exit program

//intro setup

	//set up starting variables round, player input, scores

	//set up while loop for wanted input aka filter out gibberish

                //output player choice
		//create random number generator and computer choice
		//output computer choice

		//tie scenario
			//output draw and don't change score
			//output score
		//rock loses to paper scenario
                        //output lose and increase denominator of score
			//output score
                
		//rock wins to scissors scenario
                        //output win and increase numerator and denominator of score
			//output score

		//paper wins to rock scenario
                        //output win and increase numerator and denominator of score
			//output score

		//paper loses to scissors scenario
                        //output lose and increase denominator of score
			//output score
                
		//scissors wins to paper scenario
                        //output win and increase numerator and denominator of score
			//output score
                        
		//scissors loses to rock scenario
			//output lose and increase denominator of score
			//output score
	//update round
	//differentiate between gibberish and exiting
//end
